Ideas for a me operating system (MeOS):

Things that would be really useful would be:

-   Calendar integration so that I can see my week at a glance. It should be color coded so I have an integration that would allow me to change the color of a calendar event.
    
-   The ability to have reports based on that at the end of the week so if I look back at the week, what did I do, how did I spend my time, and where are the gaps? Gaps by day would be really interesting so this would be unstructured time, time that wasn’t calendared. How much was it? I should have a to-do or a skill that will look at my day yesterday and my upcoming day (or any day that I give it) and be an interactive prompt to assign colors. The colors should have semantic value.
    
-   It would be nice to turn that into a script so it’s repeatable and I don’t need to use an LLM to do it but it would be nice if the LLM could invoke it.
    

Other things would be:

-   A totally new way to run a one-on-one. If I can get back to writing handwritten notes, that would be kind of the goal. I write a handwritten note and then I take that and I talk to my computer in the MeOS. The MeOS will then produce a report for the one-on-one that’s both my raw text (meaning what I said) as well as a summary. The summary should be able to be copied and pasted into Lattice, for example, or any other documentation. Maybe it’s back to a one-on-one doc in Google Docs. If it’s Lattice it would be really nice to integrate with their API to be able to provide the feedback directly from the tool and log it.
    
-   How do I integrate with JIRA to understand different projects, their timelines, what’s going well, what’s not? JIRA has an MCP server and I think when I spin up a project it would be good to have a skill or a repeatable set of tasks that can look into project performance, maybe see which tickets have changed status, who has pushed code to the repo. DX has access to a lot of this but what I’d like is for maybe a personal dashboard that helps me navigate all of this rather than go into a bunch of different tools. I have my tool which syncs nightly or my tool which can answer these questions on-demand.
